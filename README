Just some trivial scripts. They simplify listening to audio streams
from polskieradio.pl under linux. Requirements:

  o mplayer - everything needs this
  o rtmpdump - for moje.polskieradio.pl
  o curl - for program_name
  o python - for running Makefile (and make, of course)

mplayer:
o project page: http://www.mplayerhq.hu/
o I'm pretty sure, that mplayer is in your distro or your distro repositories
o so, in Ubuntu type: "sudo apt-get install mplayer"

rtmpdump:
o project page: http://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu/
o something about rtmpdump: http://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu/
o deb binaries: http://debian-multimedia.org/pool/main/r/rtmpdump/rtmpdump.php
