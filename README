Just some trivial scripts. They simplify listening to audio streams
from polskieradio.pl under linux. Requirements:

  o mplayer - everything needs this
  o rtmpdump - for moje.polskieradio.pl

rtmpdump:
o project page http://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu/
o something about rtmpdump: http://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu/
o deb binaries: http://debian-multimedia.org/pool/main/r/rtmpdump/rtmpdump.php
